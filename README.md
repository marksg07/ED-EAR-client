If the gallery link isn't working, to install:
1. Download/clone this repo.
2. Go to Fitbit Studio: studio.fitbit.com
3. Make an account/log in.
4. Create a new blank project.
5. Drag in all the files from this repo (if this doesn't work on your OS for whatever reason, you can copy in the files one at a time).
6. Set up the Versa and the phone connected to it to use the Developer Bridge:

       In the Fitbit mobile app, navigate to your device page (click on the watch icon from the main menu), click Developer Menu, and turn on the Developer Bridge.
       
       Make sure you have a Wifi network in range and set up correctly on the Versa.
       
       On the Versa, navigate to Settings and click on the Developer Bridge. Wait until it says "Connected to Server."
       
       On the Fitbit studio page, click where it says "Select a phone/Select a device", and refresh. Once both your phone and Versa appear in the menu, click them both.
       
7. Run the app.
At this point, you can close out of the app and Fitbit Studio and the app should persist on your Versa.
